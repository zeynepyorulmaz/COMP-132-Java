# Lab 2.5 (Debugging Lab)

### Before attempting this lab, review the material about debugging on the course site (Extra Resources tab). 

In this lab, you have been provided a partially completed file with some array manipulation methods inside. Your task is to use debugging to find the errors/problems with the code, and fix them so that all of the outputs match what is expected. Furthermore, there is a new method, `sortDescending`, which you are expected to write by yourself, by adapting the approach used in `sortAscending`. Details about every method is described in comments in the file. 

## You must use the same general approach as `sortAscending`, but modified for descending instead. Do not write your own sort method, otherwise we will not grade that part of your lab.

## Grading Details
During the lab hours on Friday, you will be expected to demonstrate to the TA/SLs how you used debugging to find the errors, as well as showing that the code works as expected.
